# dash dthree hooks

dash dthree hooks is a Dash component library for charts using D3 and React Hooks.

For more information on how to create custom components, I refer to the [original Dash documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/plugins). Dash also provides two examples of D3 charts [here](https://dash.plotly.com/d3-react-components), however hooks are not used.

Big shoutout to [`muratkemaldar`](https://github.com/muratkemaldar/using-react-hooks-with-d3) for the inspiration to use `ResizeObserver` for responsiveness.
