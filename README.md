# dash dthree hooks

dash dthree hooks is a Dash component library for charts using D3 and React Hooks.

For more information on how to create custom components, I refer to the [original Dash documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/plugins). Dash also provides two examples of D3 charts [here](https://dash.plotly.com/d3-react-components), however hooks are not used.

## Usage

Get started with:
1. Install Dash and its dependencies: https://dash.plotly.com/installation
2. Run `python usage.py`
3. Visit http://localhost:8050 in your web browser
